# üö® EMERGENCY FIX - Getting Your Game Working NOW

## The Problem
Your repository `Verb-practice-game` either:
- Doesn't exist yet
- Is private (GitHub Pages needs public repos for free hosting)
- Files aren't uploaded

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION: Follow These 6 Steps EXACTLY

---

## STEP 1: Create Repository (2 minutes)

1. **Go to:** https://github.com/new

2. **Fill in:**
   - Repository name: `verb-practice-game` (lowercase, easier to type)
   - Description: `Icelandic verb conjugation practice`
   - ‚úÖ **Public** (MUST be checked!)
   - ‚úÖ Check "Add a README file"

3. **Click:** "Create repository"

**‚úÖ You should now see:** `https://github.com/chrisayliffe/verb-practice-game`

---

## STEP 2: Download the Game File

```

**Download it:**
1. Look at the file tree on the left
2. Navigate to `/app/frontend/public/`
3. Find `icelandic-verb-game-dynamic.html`
4. Click it, then click the download icon
5. Save to your computer

**Alternative:** I can show you the file content to copy-paste if download isn't working.

---

## STEP 3: Upload to GitHub (1 minute)

1. **In your new repository**, click: **"Add file"** ‚Üí **"Upload files"**

2. **Drag and drop** the `icelandic-verb-game-dynamic.html` file you just downloaded

3. **Scroll down**, click: **"Commit changes"**

**‚úÖ You should now see** the file listed in your repository

---

## STEP 4: Enable GitHub Pages (30 seconds)

1. **In your repository**, click: **"Settings"** (top menu bar)

2. **In left sidebar**, click: **"Pages"**

3. **Under "Build and deployment":**
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch** ‚úÖ
   - Branch: **main** (select from dropdown)
   - Folder: **/ (root)** (select from dropdown)

4. **Click:** **"Save"**

5. **Look for the green box** that appears:
   ```
   ‚úÖ Your site is live at https://chrisayliffe.github.io/verb-practice-game/
   ```

---

## STEP 5: Wait (2 minutes)

GitHub needs time to deploy. 

- **Go get a coffee** ‚òï
- **Wait 2-3 minutes**
- **Don't skip this step!**

---

## STEP 6: Test Your URL

**Test URL 1 (File Only):**
```
https://chrisayliffe.github.io/verb-practice-game/icelandic-verb-game-dynamic.html
```

**Expected:** Should load the game (might show an error about lesson, that's OK)

**Test URL 2 (With Lesson):**
```
https://chrisayliffe.github.io/verb-practice-game/icelandic-verb-game-dynamic.html?lesson=Lesson 1
```

**Expected:** Should load your lesson from Google Sheets

---

## üéØ Your URLs Will Be

**Pattern:**
```
https://chrisayliffe.github.io/verb-practice-game/icelandic-verb-game-dynamic.html?lesson=TAB_NAME
```

**Examples:**
```
For "Lesson 1" tab:
https://chrisayliffe.github.io/verb-practice-game/icelandic-verb-game-dynamic.html?lesson=Lesson 1

For "Lesson 2" tab:
https://chrisayliffe.github.io/verb-practice-game/icelandic-verb-game-dynamic.html?lesson=Lesson 2

For "Beginner" tab:
https://chrisayliffe.github.io/verb-practice-game/icelandic-verb-game-dynamic.html?lesson=Beginner
```

---

## üîç Troubleshooting

### If Test URL 1 Shows 404:

**Check:**
1. Is file named EXACTLY `icelandic-verb-game-dynamic.html`?
2. Is it in the root folder (not in a subfolder)?
3. Did you wait 2-3 minutes after enabling Pages?
4. Is repository public?

**Fix:**
- Go to: https://github.com/chrisayliffe/verb-practice-game
- You should see the file listed
- If not, re-upload it

### If Test URL 2 Shows Error Message:

**Check your Google Sheet:**
1. Go to: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TvQ8qTJ2IkaRbyJa3JNbjbLOM0peubS0VDNGupHwZes/edit
2. Click "Share" ‚Üí "Anyone with the link" ‚Üí Viewer
3. Make sure you have a tab called "Lesson 1"
4. Check the structure matches the template

### If Nothing Works:

**Verify GitHub Pages is enabled:**
1. Go to: https://github.com/chrisayliffe/verb-practice-game/settings/pages
2. Should show: "Your site is live at..."
3. If not, repeat Step 4

## üéì Embed in LearnWorlds

Once working, embed with:

```html
<iframe 
    src="https://chrisayliffe.github.io/verb-practice-game/icelandic-verb-game-dynamic.html?lesson=Lesson 1"
    width="100%"
    height="900"
    frameborder="0"
    style="border: none; border-radius: 8px;">
</iframe>
```

**Change `Lesson 1` to match your tab name.**

---

## üìû Still Stuck?

**Tell me:**
1. ‚úÖ Did you create the repository?
2. ‚úÖ Can you see the file in your repo?
3. ‚úÖ What does GitHub Pages settings page show?
4. ‚úÖ What error do you see when you visit the URL?

**Provide:**
- Screenshot of your repository file list
- Screenshot of Settings ‚Üí Pages
- Exact error message you see

---

## üöÄ Alternative: Use Pre-Made Files

If Google Sheets version is too complex, use these simpler files:

**Option 1:** `lesson-1-nutid-basic.html` (Present tense only, 2 verbs)
**Option 2:** `lesson-2-both-tenses.html` (Both tenses, 3 verbs)

**These work WITHOUT Google Sheets** - verbs are hardcoded in the file.

**Location:** `/app/frontend/public/`

**URL would be:**
```
https://chrisayliffe.github.io/verb-practice-game/lesson-1-nutid-basic.html
```

---

## ‚ú® Next Steps Once Working

1. ‚úÖ Test all your lesson URLs
2. ‚úÖ Create more tabs in Google Sheets
3. ‚úÖ Embed working URLs in LearnWorlds
4. ‚úÖ Celebrate! üéâ

**The key is:** Repository must be PUBLIC and file must be in the root folder!
